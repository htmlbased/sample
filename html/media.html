	<h1>Adding Images</h1>
	<p>It is an Self Containing Element having an src atrribute if there is any problem with image then the alternative text will be displayed in place of the image</p>
	<img src="mona.jpg" alt="Udaya mouni boppana" height="950" width="750"> 
	<p>We basically set the height of an image based on that it will automatically take the width but it is far more better to use CSS instead of html attributes for maintaining the numerous images with the same size html is inappropriate, it can be easily done by using CSS if its having less images then we can use html and it provide more meaning towards semantically</p>
